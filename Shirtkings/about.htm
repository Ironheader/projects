            <h3>What is ShirtKings</h3>
               <p>ShirtKings is a buisness that sells shirts. Founded by Timarco in 2022, he is striving to create a brand for anyone to be
               a fan of. We can benefit communities because you can design shirts for a family reunion or a workplace.</p>
            <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
               <img src="img/reading.jpg" alt="reading" class="left">
               <p>Timarco always had a passion for being a business man. Born in 2003. He was destined to be a star
               according to his relatives. In 2020, he was thinking of ideas to do during quarantine. However, nothing flourished because he was
               scared of failure, so had no drive to become a business man and create his own business. In late 2021, He said, "Why wallow in <em>can't </em>when I can see if I can!" and worked on his goal.</p>
               <p> There were times he wanted to give up and just be like the rest of the people. Timarco did not know what to do and where to go. He was at an ideas block until he was scrolling through TikTok one day and a video was showing various T-shirt designs. A literal light bulb flashed above his head. He was under the ceiling fan, and the lightbulb flickered. A coincidence? You be the judge of that. ShirtKings was born! </p>

               <h3>Testing the waters</h3>
               <p>2021 and 2022 was the testing period for his shirt business. He made simple shirts. Someone he knew became a certified medical assistant, so he made a shirt to celebrate their acheivement and gifted it to them. He was rewarded for his work. Timarco did it for free,
               but was tipped because of his service. He realized this buisness could be profitable. He decided to branch out to create his own identity. He decided on Hold Dat Fye to be his first shirt to sell. After countless design attempts, he belived this was the one.
